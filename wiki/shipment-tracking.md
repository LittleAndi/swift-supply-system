Master the art of shipment visibility and tracking across all transportation modes.

## Understanding Shipment Status

Our platform tracks shipments through various statuses:
- **In Transit** - Currently moving towards destination
- **At Port** - Awaiting customs clearance or next transport
- **Delivered** - Successfully reached final destination
- **Delayed** - Behind schedule with updated ETA
- **Exception** - Requires attention or intervention

## Multi-Modal Journey Visualization

Each shipment displays:
- **Journey Timeline** - Visual representation of the complete route
- **Current Location** - Real-time position updates
- **Transport Modes** - Sea, air, rail, and road segments
- **Milestone Tracking** - Key checkpoints and timestamps
